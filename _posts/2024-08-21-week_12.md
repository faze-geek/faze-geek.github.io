**Extending the project**
.... Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

Since my mentors were busy most of this month and will find time to review the complete end to end project after the 19th, we thought that it would be useful to extend our project by 2 weeks.
My mentors believe this is a smart approach, although the project is on track of completion this will give us a cushion for mistakes and unfortunate events.

**Aim :** 

My aim for this week is to keep resolving minor bugs, communicating with my mentors regarding requirements for passing the evaluation and start running the test files with pocketpy pybind.

**Work :** 

I made the following pull requests this week. \
Each of them are self explanatory in nature.

- **[PR#59](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/59)** : **Update math functions to return numeric types as per dimension**
- **[PR#60](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/60)** : **Update default return type of np.mean, np.std, np.var.**
- **[PR#61](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/61)** : **Add uniform random distribution function**
- **[PR#62](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/62)** : **Return float64 array on boolean division.**

  I also had to resolve the following warnings that appeared in windows MVSC so that the application works cross platform -

  Since I was majorly developing on a MAC OS machine, figuring out these warnings just by looking at them was quite the challenge.
  
- **[PR#63](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/63)** : **Remove warnings with the / operator**
- **[PR#64](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/64)** : **Fix MVSC build warnings**
- **[PR#65](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/65)** : **Fix matrix multiplication warnings**

**Future Work :**

  In this upcoming week, tensions will be high since it would have a huge impact on if I pass or fail the project. I will be patiently waiting for my mentor's suggestions and then be sure to get done with them as soon as possible.
