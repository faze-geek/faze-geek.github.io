**Planning for the future**
.... Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

This week was more on the chill side, I did not have any huge coding tasks to complete but involved lots of learning and reading documentation.

**Aim :** 

My aim for this week was to initiate the testing, making my coding and research workflow more streamlined, and mainly getting previous pull requests approved by my mentors. \
The next step is writing tests for numpy. I was already familiar with Pytest, but had not worked with Google tests. Pytest is easy to use. Once I could provide some tests, we could collectively assess the stability of pocketpy pybind.

**Work :** 

I raised the following pull requests this week.

- **[PR#12](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/12)** : **Array initialization and Aggregation function tests**
  
**Future Work :**

In the upcoming week, I need to consistently add more tests, report any bugs with pybind11 and start the implementation of the numpy Random module.
