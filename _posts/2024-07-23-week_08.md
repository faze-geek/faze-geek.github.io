**Yayy, I passed the midterm evaluation**
.... Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

We have reached into week 8 of the project and I have passed the first evaluation. Although I am satisfied with my work upto the midterm evaluation, I cannot become complacent. I have to keep improving and upgrading the use cases of my project.

**Aim :** 

My aim for this week is to resolve bugs we had not tackled in the past weeks.

**Work :** 

I made the following pull requests this week -

- **[PR#35](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/35)** : **Add Resize**
  ```  
  a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
  a.resize([1, 4])
  assert_equal(a, np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4]]))
  ```
  As of now, our implementation does not preserve elements if expected size is not equal to the current size.
  You can have a look at this issue to know the reason - https://github.com/xtensor-stack/xtensor/issues/1445 
  
- **[PR#36](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/36)** : **Add proper spaces for indentation**
- **[PR#37](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/37)** : **Add dtypes as string attributes of numpy module**
- **[PR#38](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/38)** : **Add the tolist function**
  
  ```
  a = np.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3])
  assert a.tolist() == [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]
  ```
  
- **[PR#39](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/39)** : **Added dtype argument for array creation**
- **[PR#40](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/40)** : **Change default integer precision to int64**

  This change has been made in the latest versions of numpy, where maximum precision for integer type is increased from 32 bits to 64 bits.
- **[PR#41](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/41)** : **Register all dtypes**

  With this pull request we have started to support the following dtypes -
  
  ```
  #Boolean
  > `pkpy::bool_`
  
  #Integer
  > `pkpy::int8`
  > `pkpy::int16`
  > `pkpy::int32`
  > `pkpy::int64`
  > `pkpy::int_`
  
  #Floating
  > `pkpy::float32`
  > `pkpy::float64`
  > `pkpy::float_`
  ```

  Now the only dtypes left to support are, unsigned and complex datatypes.

- **[PR#42](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/42)** : **Correct output of np.shape**

  With this pull request we correctly return a `py::tuple` instead of a `std::vector`.
  
**Future Work :**

In this upcoming week, we need to reduce disk space required for the project and complete on all the numpy dtypes.
