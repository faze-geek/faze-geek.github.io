**Completing the project**
.... Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

Finally we have reached to the end of my project, after this week I just have to integrate my project into the main repository and submit my final report to Google admins.

**Aim :** 

My aim for this week is to keep resolving minor bugs, communicating with my mentors regarding requirements for passing the evaluation and start running the test files with pocketpy pybind.

**Work :** 

I made the following pull requests this week.
Most of them, are random bugs that I found and my mentor pointed out. 

- **[PR#67](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/67)** : **Change boolean output**

- **[PR#72](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/72)** : **Refactor some tests**
- **[PR#73](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/73)** : **Fix set item for N-d vector assignment**
- **[PR#75](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/75)** : **Club test files into 1 file**
- **[PR#76](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/76)** : **Add flag to suppress warnings**
- **[PR#77](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/77)** : **Add test numpy.cpp**

**Future Work :**

  In this upcoming week, I have to clean up the existing project at gsoc-2024-dev and integrate it with pocketpy. It is definite that I will pass the project, what is left is just applying my final touches.
