**Phase 2 Continues**
.... Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

Last week I raised a couple of issues and pull requests, making progress in the work I proposed for phase 2 of GSOC. This week, my task was to make sure I get them merged successfully and also add methods for measuring margins of transfer functions.

**Aim :**

I could get approvals on these two pull requests - [#25329](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/25329) and [#25335](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/25335). They are considerably close to merging.

Along with that I have prepared the phase and gain margin implementations. The `margin` pull request needs some polishing so I have not pushed it yet. 


**Work : Let us go through the Pull Requests in brief.**
1. `Phase Margin & Gain Margin`:
   
   **Phase Margin** - The phase margin is the difference between the phase of the response and –180° when the loop gain is 1.0.
   ```
   Pm = phi + 180      # Where phi is the phase lag.  
   ```
   **Gain Margin** - Gm is the amount of gain variance required to make the loop gain unity at the frequency Wcg where the phase angle is –180° (modulo 360°).
   ```
   Gm (in db) = 20*log10(Gm)
   ```
   I intend to send in these implementations soon.


**Future Work :**
This will be the latest set of implementations I will be making for my Phase 2 work. I would like to get them in the codebase as soon as possible. Once that is done, I would shift to Phase 3 work where I will work on **State Space Models**.
