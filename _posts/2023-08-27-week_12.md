**I can see the finale**
.... Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

As I have completed 3 weeks of phase 3, I feel I have reached at the climax of this project. As I mentioned in my punchline I can definitely see this project moving towards completion. From now I have 3 weeks remaining in Google Summer Of Code'23. Implementation of the State Space Model is finished and awaiting reviews. This week I did not have too much on my plate, I focused on improving the visual representation of the class.

**Aim :**

This week I made some comments towards the **State Space model**. It can be viewed [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/25473). 

I pushed the Implementation of the **Nyquist Plot**. It can be viewed [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/25575). This became possible after I got in touch with [@Davide-sd](https://github.com/Davide-sd ). \
He has been working on the refactoring the existing plotting module along with adding new functions to it. He has provided a [roadmap](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/25575#issuecomment-1689890804) which will eliminate a major blocker, the dependency on `matplotlib` scatter plot that has stalled pull requests related to the control plots. 

I also opened up an [issue](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/25576) - **Feature Request : Support for Arrows in Sympy's plotting module**. I need them to show the trajectory of the plots.

**Work : Let us go through the Pull Requests in brief.**
1. Representations :
   
   Default representations:
    ```
    >>> from sympy import *
    >>> from sympy.physics.control import *
    >>> ss3 = StateSpace(Matrix([[-1.5, -2], [1, 0]]),
    ...                     Matrix([[0.5, 0], [0, 1]]),
    ...                     Matrix([[0, 1], [0, 2]]),
    ...                     Matrix([[2, 2], [1, 1]]))
    
    >>> ss3               # Will look better if each matrix starts at a new line.
    StateSpace(Matrix([
    [-1.5, -2],
    [   1,  0]]), Matrix([
    [0.5, 0],
    [  0, 1]]), Matrix([
    [0, 1],
    [0, 2]]), Matrix([
    [2, 2],
    [1, 1]]))
    
    >>> pprint(ss3)      # Will look better if each matrix is separately pretty printed inside a block representation. 
     StateSpace(Matrix([
         [-1.5, -2],
    [   1,  0]]), Matrix([
          [0.5, 0],
     [  0, 1]]), Matrix([
           [0, 1],
      [0, 2]]), Matrix([
           [2, 2],
          [1, 1]]))
    ```
    
    My diff implements the suggestions in the comments:
    ```
    >>> ss3
    StateSpace(
    Matrix([
    [-1.5, -2],
    [   1,  0]]),
    
    Matrix([
    [0.5, 0],
    [  0, 1]]),
    
    Matrix([
    [0, 1],
    [0, 2]]),
    
    Matrix([
    [2, 2],
    [1, 1]]))
    
    >>> pprint(ss3)
    
    ⎡⎡-1.5  -2⎤  ⎡0.5  0⎤⎤
    ⎢⎢        ⎥  ⎢      ⎥⎥
    ⎢⎣ 1    0 ⎦  ⎣ 0   1⎦⎥
    ⎢                   ⎥
    ⎢  ⎡0  1⎤     ⎡2  2⎤ ⎥
    ⎢  ⎢    ⎥     ⎢    ⎥ ⎥
    ⎣  ⎣0  2⎦     ⎣1  1⎦ ⎦
    ```
**Future Work :**
Now, thorough reviews and design discussions for this pull request will be done. \
After that the last major pull request of my GSOC project, evaluating the State Space Model will be remaining.
