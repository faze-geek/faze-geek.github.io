**Mid-term evaluation approaching**
.... Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

This week was indeed a heavy week as far as project planning and code discussion was concerned. I managed to submit requested code submissions before the deadline and my mentor @blueloveTH was satisfied with the work.

**Aim :** 

My aim for this week was to get my code compatible with pocketpy pybind and prepare a wokring demo for my mentors.

**Work :** 

This is the demo I prepared for my mentors. The frontend is at a basic stage but that will be improved as soon as the backend is ready. 

  ### How to run **numpy** module programs with **gsoc-2024-dev** [pybind11](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/tree/main/pybind11)
  
  1. Prepare the python code file with the numpy operations you want to run. \
  
   For example : let's try out numpy [arange](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html) function in `test_numpy.py`
  ```
    import numpy_bindings as np
      
    def test_arange(n):
        a = np.arange(n)
        print(a.sum())
      
    test_arange(100)
  ```
  
  2. Read the script and execute it in `test_main.cpp`. 
  ```
     #include <pybind11/embed.h>
     #include <fstream>
     #include <sstream>
     #include <string>
      
     namespace py = pybind11;
     using namespace pybind11;
      
     int main() {
       py::scoped_interpreter guard{};
       std::ifstream file("test_numpy.py");
       std::stringstream buffer;
       buffer << file.rdbuf();
       std::string script = buffer.str();
       py::exec(script);
      
       return 0;
    }
  ```
  
  3. Build the project at root to generate the executable at `build/gsoc2024`.
  ```
    cmake -B build
    cmake --build build
  ```
  4. Now run the executable to get the output. 
  ```
    |base| gsoc-2024-dev ±|main ✗|→ build/gsoc2024 
    4950
  ```

I made the following pull requests this week -

- **[PR#30](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/30)** : **Refactor some functions into properties**
  
  The pull request makes `dtype`, `ndim`, `shape`, `size` as readonly properties instead of member functions. I had to use the **def_readonly_property** label from pybind11 to ensure it.

- **[PR#31](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/31)** : **Make print inline with numpy**

  The pull request fixes the following bug - 
  ```
  >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  >>> a
  ```
  ```
  # cpython's numpy
  array([1, 2, 3])
  ```
  ```
  # ours
  ndarray(
  {1, 2, 3}
  )
  ``` 
- **[PR#32](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/32)** : **Remove xoptional headers**
- **[PR#33](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/33)** : **Removed unrequired data convertors**
- **[PR#34](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/34)** : **Remove xjson from xtl headers as well**

**Future Work :**

In this upcoming week, we will start work after the mid term evaluation. I am pretty confident that I will pass this evaluation. Following that we need to reduce disk space required for the project and start working on all the numpy dtypes.
