**Getting Pull Requests In**
.... Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

This week has been a significant week in my initial work. Interactions with my mentor [@blueloveTH](https://github.com/blueloveTH) and his suggestions gave considerable directions to the project.
I appreciate him for being clear and to the point, and would like to thanks him for the freedom he gives me to explore on my own self.

**Aim :**

My aim for this week was to get [PR#4](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/4) by my mentors. I aim for the code in `numpy.hpp` to be robust for all use cases and for all dtpyes. 

**Work :**


**Future Work :**
In the upcoming week, I would implement the python bindings code in `numpy.cpp` and send in a pull request as soon as possible.
