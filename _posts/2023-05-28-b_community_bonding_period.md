Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

As **Google Summer Of Code'23** has begun with a blast, here we are at the end of the Community Bonding Period.
This period is a process where newly selected contributors are welcomed within the community and given an idea about how Google run GSoC. \
In the start of this period, there was an introductory meet with Google admins who explained us about the program and the various key factors that lead to a successful project. It was followed by a contributors summit where mentors and past GSoC'ers gave speeches. Although I started this phase a little late because of my ongoing endsemester exams, I have thoroughly enjoyed this phase .

Here is some of the work I did during this period - 
1. **Prerequisites**
- Check my existing setup for SymPy and run tests successfully.
- Built the documentation and ran the html pages on a live server.
- Set up this blog, a necessary component requested by  [Aaron Meurer](https://github.com/asmeurer).

2. **Meeting with Mentors**
- This was my first live interaction with Nikhil and Smit, my mentors for this project.
- An important sub-topic we discussed was the time I would have to devote weekly towards this project. As a result of my next academic semester beginning just after the mid term evaluation I thought it will be better if I could extend my project from **12** weeks to **16** weeks ,and my mentors didn't have any issues with that.
- We planned to setup a communication channel soon and decided a time for our weekly meetings. 

3. **Starting the Project**
- To be honest with the readers, I had prepared this proposal a long time ago (about a year ago) when I had my Signals and Systems course. At that time the ideas for my proposal came naturally to me. But as time went by I have forgotten stuff about control systems and it's concepts. I went through the SymPy documentation and wil need to read continuously as I code in parallel.
- Other than that I started brainstorming ideas, which I will communicate to my mentors when the coding period starts.I made 4-5 **Github Gists** which do not have polished code but instead have chunks of ideas to build upon. You can go through them here - https://gist.github.com/faze-geek

All and all it was a very useful phase of me. It helped me to settle in the SymPy community as a contributor, make new connections and increase my network in the open source space.
