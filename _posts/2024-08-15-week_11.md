**Final evaluation is coming soon**
.... Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

**Aim :** 

In this week we tackled minor bugs that I had come across while testing. They were little but many in number.

**Work :** 

I made the following pull requests this week. \
All of these are pretty self explanatory in nature.

- **[PR#51](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/51)** : **Register float dtype of 32 bit precision**
- **[PR#52](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/52)** : **Minor changes in tests to reflect recent changes**
- **[PR#53](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/53)** : **Make set_item exhaustive and test all cases**
- **[PR#54](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/54)** : **Update aggregation functions to handle all dtypes**
- **[PR#55](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/55)** : **Support binary operations for all dtypes**
- **[PR#56](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/56)** : **Correct setitem for 1d arrays**
- **[PR#55](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/57)** : **Miscellaneous Additions**
- **[PR#56](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/58)** : **Added the __ne__ dunder method**

**Future Work :**

  In this upcoming week, my mentors will go through my code and try to find bugs through manual testing. I will have to make sure my code robustly covers all the expected use cases.
  It will involve testing my implementations for edge cases and completely adding the functions from the `numpy.pyi` typing file.
