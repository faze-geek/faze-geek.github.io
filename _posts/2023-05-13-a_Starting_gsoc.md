I am very happy to share with you that on 4th May, 2023 I was accepted as a
GSoC student of [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/). I would be working on control module under the guidance
of my mentors, [Smit Lunagariya](https://github.com/Smit-create) and [Nikhil Maan](https://github.com/Sc0rpi0n101).

I have interacted with Smit before on a different project named LPython. We had discussed a couple of issues. I look forward to interacting with Nikhil too. I have no doubt in my mind that working under their guidance will be a great learning experience for me.

As of now my end semester exams and results are going on. I expected the selection email being one of the happiest moments in my life but having to prepare for a tough exam the following day, I was busy keeping up with the portion at 12:30 am. I hardly celebrated for 15 minutes :)
I have set up my blog today by forking this [repository](https://github.com/czgdp1807/czgdp1807.github.io) from [Gagandeep Singh](https://github.com/czgdp1807). He is a previous contributor to SymPy and well known in the community.
