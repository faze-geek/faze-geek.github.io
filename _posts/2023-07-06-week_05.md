**Starting Phase 2**
.... Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

Last week I could get my 2nd Pull Request merged in. Alongside I also gave a brief introduction about phase 2. In this phase I'll be making some improvements in the codebase like adding more useful methods to the `TransferFunction` and `TransferFunctionMatrix` classes and enhancing the design to improve user-friendliness.

**Aim :**

My purpose this week was to investigate the `control/lti.py` file and find potential areas of improvement. Once I completed an entire sluething I wanted to raise issues, so that we can discuss upon them as a community. Eventually I'll be fixing those issues in the upcoming week as this week I patiently await to get clarity on the expected results.

These are the issues I have opened up. Kindly comment on them if you are interested in the project !

1. [How should division of Transfer Functions be handled](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/25308)
2. [How should subs() be handled for Transfer Functions](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/25315)
3. [Restrict Inputs to only valid Transfer Functions](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/25326)

**Work : Let us go through the Pull Request and the reviews I addressed in brief.**

I will show brief examples on what I implemented in the pull request.
1. `from_coeff_lists` - This is derived from the **MATLAB** and **Python-control** input schemes. We can inialize our transfer function through numerator and denominator sequences.
   ```
        >>> from sympy.abc import s, p
        >>> from sympy.physics.control.lti import TransferFunction
        >>> num = [1, 0, 2]
        >>> den = [3, 2, 2, 1]
        >>> tf = TransferFunction.from_coeff_lists(num, den, s)
        >>> tf
        TransferFunction(s**2 + 2, 3*s**3 + 2*s**2 + 2*s + 1, s)
   ```
2. `from_zpk` - On many ocassions, users will have to build up a transfer functions from it's poles and zeros. This method helps in such initializations.
   ```
        >>> from sympy.abc import s, p, k
        >>> from sympy.physics.control.lti import TransferFunction
        >>> zeros = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> poles = [6, 5, 4]
        >>> gain = 7
        >>> tf = TransferFunction.from_zpk(zeros, poles, gain, s)
        >>> tf
        TransferFunction(7*(s - 3)*(s - 2)*(s - 1), (s - 6)*(s - 5)*(s - 4), s)
   ```


**Observations and Challenges :**

This week went by smoothly and rather fast I would say. The new pull request got merged in 3-4 days and did not provide any major challenges. The challenge for the upcoming weeks is to make sure that we figure out a way to get Pull Request 2 in the codebase. Those plots are extremely essential for graphical analysis. Defeciency on my part in addressing the suggestion should not lead to stalling of the pull request.

**Future Work :**
In this upcoming week I would be opening up some issues related to improvements and upgrades in the codebase as we are shifting into phase 2. It is crutial to discuss ideas on these issues, so that I have clarity on my future Pull Requests.
