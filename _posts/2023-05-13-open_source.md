It was December 2021 when my winter vacation had just begun. I had returned home after a tiring semester and was eager to explore new fields during that one-month break. I remember starting with web development, and every time I finished a mini project, the course instructor would mention that it should be hosted on GitHub.

At first glance, my initial interaction with GitHub was intimidating. It took me hours to figure out GitHub Pages and host a basic introduction website. That was the beginning of a beautiful journey as I delved into the world of open source. My first pull request was for an organization called SymPy, which specializes in symbolic mathematics. About a year ago, I had just cleared the JEE Advanced examination and was very familiar with the math and physics content I studied. Sequences and series, calculus, geometry, and mechanics were my areas of interest, and SymPy provided me with an opportunity to work on them right from the start.

This was a brief and concise introduction to my experience in Open Source Development.
