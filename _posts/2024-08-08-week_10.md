**I can see the finish**
.... Hello everyone, hope this blog finds you well.

After a heavy week of coding, this was a an easy going week. I have tackled most of the major tasks, so I am getting more and more eager to get this project merged into the main repo.

**Aim :** 
My aim for this week was to add coverage for more dtypes and start fixing bugs that came up in the testing phase.

**Work :** 

I made the following pull requests this week -

- **[PR#50](https://github.com/pocketpy/gsoc-2024-dev/pull/50)** : **Register integer types with 8 and 16 bit precision**

**Future Work :**

Although I was busy this week I could get one pull request merged. In the upcoming week, I need to focus on fixing all the bugs that came up in testing and that my mentors had pointed out.
